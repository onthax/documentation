The TrueNAS community creates and maintains numerous applications intended to expand system functionality far beyond what is typically expected from a NAS.

The TrueNAS catalog is loaded by default and is used to populate the **Apps > Available Applications** tab.
To view the catalog settings, select the **Manage Catalogs** tab.

Applications are provided "as-is" and can introduce system stability or security issues when installed.
Some applications deploy as the **root** user for initial configuration before operating as a non-root user.
Make sure the application is required for your specific use requirements and doesn't violate your security policies before installation.

The remaining tutorials in this section are for specific applications that are commonly used or replace some functionality that was previously built-in with TrueNAS.
