The **Init/Shutdown Scripts** widget on the **System > Advanced** screen allows you to add scripts to run before or after initialization (start-up), or at shutdown. For example, creating a script to backup your system or run a systemd command before exiting and shutting down the system.

## Adding an Init/Shutdown Script

The **Init/Shutdown Scripts** widget displays **No Init/Shutdown Scripts configured** until you add either a command or script, and then the widget lists the scripts configured on the system.

Click **Add** to open the **Add Init/Shutdown Script** configuration screen.

Enter a description and then select **Command** or **Script** from the **Type** dropdown list. Selecting **Script** displays additional options.

Enter the command string in **Command**, or if using a script, enter or use the browse to the path in **Script**. The script runs using [dash(1)](https://manpages.debian.org/testing/dash/sh.1.en.html "dash(1) Page").

Select the option from the **When** dropdown list for the time this command or script runs.

Enter the number of seconds after the script runs that the command should stop in **Timeout**.

Select **Enable** to enable the script. Leave clear to disable but not delete the script.

Click **Save**.

## Editing an Init/Shutdown Script

Click a script listed on the **Init/Shutdown Scripts** widget to open the **Edit Inti/Shutdown Script** configuration screen populated with the settings for that script.

You can change from a command to a script, modify the script or command as needed.

To disable but not delete the command or script, clear the **Enabled** checkbox.

Click **Save**.
